The aim of this paper is to identify the potential indicators that may forecast economic
recessions in the United States. After an estimation of the recession periods based on the
industrial production index by the algorithm of Bry and Boshan covering the period 1980
to 2021, three methods will be used to determine the best model to forecast economic recessions: the traditional approach using probit and logit models and then news approaches
using different types of machine learning algorithms: the decision tree and the random
forest. The database has been made by extracting variables from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). After a comparison between our three methods, our results highlight that logistic regression do better than decision trees and random forest in ouf-ofsample with the AUC criterion. However, with different metrics used, the other models
do better when it comes to forecast economic crises.
